# Fictional Umbrella

We can find some tips on writing on MarkDown [here](https://wordpress.com/support/markdown-quick-reference/). All the datasets are to be found in the [Wiki.](https://github.com/nonsonopippo/fictional-umbrella/wiki)

## How to contribute to the Wiki!
### 1. Add a new dataset
Go to "Wiki" and click on the green button "New Page". The title should be the name of the dataset, the body should be written following a consistent format, so to save everyone's time! So, please, refer to the [<ins>**"guidelines for new wiki pages.txt".**</ins>](https://github.com/nonsonopippo/fictional-umbrella/blob/main/guidelines%20for%20new%20wiki%20pages.txt)

### 2. Update the Wiki home page
Thanks! But now, others need to know that you added a dataset!  
Go back to "Wiki" and click on the grey button "Edit". In the list of datasets, add your own entry: `#. [Name of your dataset](link to the page)`, where # is the number of the entry.
